## Description

An Emacs major mode implementing a simple electronic flight bag.

As I'm working through incorporating more and more of what I do in computing to Emacs,
and am making an effort to learn more lisp and use it in my day to day tasks, I thought
it would be fun to create a major mode for emacs to assist me in flight planning.

The basic idea is to have a mode in Emacs that presents a simple form along with relevant
weather data from sources deemed acceptable for use by pilots as noted by the FAA. That form
would then translate to a printable Navlog suitable for use on a kneeboard and could be
referenced by the pilot before and during the flight.

As I'm a Private Pilot who flies VFR, I've no need for the more advanced functions typical of
IFR flight plans, such as loading approach plates, or pulling alternate minimums from the airport
directories, so none of that is included here (though I'm not opposed to making the attempt at a later date).
